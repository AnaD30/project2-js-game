            The players may start by counting to three aloud, or by speaking the
            name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!"), raising one hand
            in a fist and swinging it down with each syllable onto their other
            hand (or in a less common variant, holding it behind their back).
            They then "throw" or "shoot" by extending their selected sign
            towards their opponent on what would have been the fourth count,
            often saying the word "shoot" while doing so.

            The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each
            player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner
            is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated
            until a winner is found. Almost always, the boys will all pick Spock
            at the same time and tie over and over again.Scissors cuts
            Paper,Paper covers Rock,Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons
            Spock,Spock smashes Scissors,Scissors decapitates Lizard,Lizard eats
            Paper,Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock(and as it always
            has) Rock crushes Scissors.
